# Observer Pattern


## Intent
Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

## Structure
For a weather monitoring system, various displays (like a current conditions display or a forecast display) can act as observers to a weather data subject. When the weather data changes, all the displays update their information.
